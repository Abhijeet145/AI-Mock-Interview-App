<interview><entry><topic/><question>Explain the concept of asynchronous programming and why it's important in JavaScript.</question><answer>kjnkj </answer><feedback>The answer "kjnkj" is completely inadequate. It demonstrates zero understanding of asynchronous programming or its importance in JavaScript. This response would be marked as a failing answer in an interview setting. The candidate needs to provide a clear explanation of what asynchronous programming is (non-blocking execution, callbacks/promises/async-await), and why it's crucial for maintaining responsiveness in single-threaded environments like the browser, preventing UI freezes.
